# Requirements
Verifying and installing Java
To check that you have Java SE 1.8 or higher, enter the following in a terminal:

```java -version```
You should see something like:

```openjdk version "1.8.0_222"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_222-b10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)
You can obtain Java SE from Oracleâ€™s JDK Site.
```

You also need to have sbt installed on your machine. If so, typing the command ```which sbt``` in your terminal should produce something like 
```/usr/bin/sbt```

# Start app
To start web-server, type \
```sbt run```
